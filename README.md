# Quasi_Liquid_Layer_Order_Parameters
Investigating the Quasi-Liquid Layer on Ice Surfaces: a Comparison of Order Parameters

###We compare the results obtained using different order parameters to characterize the QLLs on hexagonal ice
and cubic ice model surfaces investigated with molecular dynamics simulations in a range of temperatures. 
For the classification task, in addition to the traditional Steinhardt order parameters in different flavours, we select 
an entropy fingerprint and a deep learning neural networks approach, which are conceptually different methodologies.###

The data file reported here for PLUMED running can be used to calculate different Steinhardt order parameters
and entrpy fingerprint parameters.
